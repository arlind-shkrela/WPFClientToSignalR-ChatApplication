# WPFClientToSignalR-ChatApplication

1) Creation of a .NET Core 5.0 web application where the Client sends text messages to the Server using SignalR (C#, JavaScript)
2) Create a WPF .NET Core 5.0 C# .Net Client for the chat hub
2) Enhancing the .Net Client such that the messages will be encrypted on Client (AES 256, C#) and decrypted on Server (C#). Store the messages in separate Files (*.txt) on the server.
3) Ongoing: Adapting the .Net Client such that it transmits an MP3 file (take any MP3 you like) in encrypted chunks to the Server. The size of the chunk is 16 kbytes. The Server decrypts the chunks and stores them in separate Files (*.chk) on the server.
5) Feel free to use Visual Studio Project solutions for any project you might have :)
